## Movie Recommendation for Social Graphs

The data used is from GroupLens and can be downloaded [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). Due to the huge amount of data the small dataset is used. The data consist of 4 csv files where 3 of them is used; movies.csv consists all the movies used, ratings.csv consists of all ratings given by users for the different movies, and tags.csv consists of tags a user have given to the movies. In total that gives 9742 movies, 100,838 ratings, 3683 tags and 600 users **insert correct number**.

To get more information about the data and how the webpage is created see the [explainer notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org). **(Put the explainer notebook up here)**
